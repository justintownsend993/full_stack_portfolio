                <h1>Justin Townsend</h1>
                <p> Hello, my name is Justin Townsend, I am a Full-Stack Web Developer.<br>
                    I began programming on May of 2018, I started with learning Front-End Development for 2 years,
                    before I started learning Back-End
                    technologies that would help me in web development.<br>
                    I have a strong passion for web development, which is why I became a Full-Stack Developer. I knew I
                    could only do so much with Front-End technologies,
                    so I had decided to learn Back-End technologies to expand my knowledge and skillset for web
                    development.<br><br>
                    Skillsets are:

                        I have built many projects, some as a learning curve, others were just for fun.

                            I wanted to challange myself to see if I could build a fully functional website using
                            React.js.<br>
                            The biggest challange was building the navigation bar with React Router, along with
                            uploading the
                            website through GitHub using Git.</p>

                        <p>This project is a 3 question quiz game created with React.js.<br>
                            I used state to update the text, so when you hit the "Reveal Answer" button,
                            the text updates to the answer, which was accomplished by using state.</p>

                            The point of this webiste was to challange myself to see if I could build a fully functional

                            with a carousel using React.js.</p>
